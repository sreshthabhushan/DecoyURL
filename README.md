### DecoyURL: Phishing Detection System

**Description:**
DecoyURL is a sophisticated phishing detection system designed to safeguard users from malicious websites attempting to steal sensitive information. By analyzing and classifying URLs as either legitimate or phishing, DecoyURL helps protect against online threats by preventing users from inadvertently visiting harmful sites. The system is built using various supervised learning algorithms, ensuring high accuracy and adaptability to evolving phishing techniques. Leveraging existing datasets of both legitimate and phishing URLs, DecoyURL is capable of identifying potentially dangerous links in real-time.

**Key Features:**
1. **Multi-Algorithm Approach:** Utilizes Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression to enhance detection accuracy and minimize false positives.
2. **Real-Time URL Analysis:** Quickly evaluates and classifies URLs, providing immediate feedback to users about the safety of a link.
3. **Comprehensive Dataset:** Trained on extensive datasets containing a variety of legitimate and phishing URLs, allowing the system to recognize diverse phishing tactics.
4. **Scalability:** Capable of processing large volumes of URLs, making it suitable for integration with web browsers, email clients, or security software.
5. **Customizable Thresholds:** Allows for adjusting sensitivity to balance between false positives and false negatives based on specific use cases.
6. **Alert and Block Mechanism:** Automatically blocks access to identified phishing sites and alerts users to potential dangers.
7. **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an intuitive interface for non-technical users to check URLs manually.
8. **Regular Updates:** Continuously learns from new data to keep up with the latest phishing strategies and techniques.
9. **Lightweight and Efficient:** Designed to run efficiently without significantly impacting system performance.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for developing the system.
- **Pandas & Numpy:** For data preprocessing, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For implementing machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For visualizing data distribution and model results.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For model experimentation, testing, and refinement.
- **Existing Phishing URL Datasets:** For training and validating the models.
- **Git/GitHub:** For version control and collaborative development.

DecoyURL provides a robust defense against phishing attacks, leveraging machine learning to protect users from online threats and enhance overall cybersecurity.
